# SwiftBrowser
This repo contains my fourth Swift project from Paul Hudson's awesome [Hacking With Swift](http://www.hackingwithswift.com/) tutorial series.

In this project we built on our new knowledge of UIBarButtonItem, UIAlertController and NSURL by producing a simple web browser app in Swift. 

This project covered WKWebView (Apple's updated web widget), UIToolbar (a toolbar component that holds UIBarButtonItems), UIProgessView, delegation, classes and structs, key-value observing, and how to create views in code.
