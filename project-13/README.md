# Instafilter
This repo contains my thirteenth Swift project from Paul Hudson's awesome [Hacking With Swift](http://www.hackingwithswift.com/) tutorial series. In this project we make a photo manipulation program using Core Image filters and a UISlider.

In project 10 we learned how to use UIImagePickerController to select and import a picture from our user's photo library. In this project, we did the reverse: writing images back to the photo library. And because we're here to learn as much as possible, we also introduced both another UIKit component, UISlider, and also a little bit of Core Image, which is Apple's high-speed image manipulation toolkit.

The project we made lets users choose a picture from their photos, then manipulate it with a series of Core Image filters. Once they are happy, they can save the processed image back to their photo library.
