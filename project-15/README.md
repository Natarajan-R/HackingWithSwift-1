# Animation
This repo contains my fifteenth Swift project from Paul Hudson's awesome [Hacking With Swift](http://www.hackingwithswift.com/) tutorial series. In this technique project we introduce one of the most important techniques in iOS development: animation.

Animating Views, or making things move and scale, is not only about making things pretty, although that's certainly a large part. It's main purpose is to gives users a sense of what's changing and why, and it helps them make sense of a state change in your program. When you use a navigation controller to show a new view controller, we don't just want it to appear. Instead, we want it to slide in, making it clear that the old screen hasn't gone away, it's just to the left of where we were.

In this technique project we try out some animation to see exactly how it works. We also meet Swift's powerful switch/case statement for the first time and learn about the CGAffineTransform struct, both of which will serve us just as well as animations.
