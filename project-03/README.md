# StormViewer Update
This repo contains my third Swift project from Paul Hudson's awesome [Hacking With Swift](http://www.hackingwithswift.com/) tutorial series.

StormViewer was the first project in the series and is an iOS 8 App written in Swift that uses the Master Detail template to produce an image viewer. In this technique project we take this app and update it to allow users to share images with their friends on Facebook.
