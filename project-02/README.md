# Guess The Flag
This repo contains my second Swift project from Paul Hudson's awesome [Hacking With Swift](http://www.hackingwithswift.com/) tutorial series.

Guess The Flag is a Swift UIKit based game that lets the user test their knowledge of world flags by showing random flags and asking them to choose which one belongs to a particular country.

This project covers @2x and @3x images, asset catalogs, integers, doubles, floats, operators (+=, ++, and --), UIButton, enums, CALayer, UIColor, random numbers, actions, string interpolation, and the UIAlertController.
