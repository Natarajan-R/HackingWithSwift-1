# Pachinko
This repo contains my eleventh Swift project from Paul Hudson's awesome [Hacking With Swift](http://www.hackingwithswift.com/) tutorial series. In this project we dive into SpriteKit to try our hand at fast 2D games with SpriteKit, use physics, blend modes, radians, CGFloat, and NSKeyedUnarchiver.

The past ten projects have been based on UIKit, Apple's user interface toolkit for iOS. We've made several games with it, and it really is very powerful, but even UIKit has its limits â€“ and fast 2D games aren't its strong suit.

A much better solution is called SpriteKit, and it's Apple's fast and easy toolkit designed specifically for 2D games. It includes sprites, fonts, physics, particle effects and more, and it's built into every iOS device. What's not to like?

This was a long tutorial because we learned an awful lot. To help keep us sane, the project was as iterative as possible. Meaning we made a small change and discussed the results, then make another small change and discussed the results, until the project was finished.

And what did we build in SpriteKit in Swift? We produced a game similar to pachinko, although a lot of people know it by the name [Peggle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggle).
