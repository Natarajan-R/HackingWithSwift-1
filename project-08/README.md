# 7 Swifty Words
This repo contains my eigth Swift project from Paul Hudson's awesome [Hacking With Swift](http://www.hackingwithswift.com/) tutorial series.

This UIKit game project has a fairly complicated user interface. We've also mixed in some great new Swift techniques, including property observers, searching through arrays, modulo, array enumeration, ranges and more!

This is another word game based on the popular indie game 7 Little Words. This will also be the first game exclusively targeting iPad because we're using a lot of space in our user interface!
