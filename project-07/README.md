# Whitehouse Petitions
This repo contains my seventh Swift project from Paul Hudson's awesome [Hacking With Swift](http://www.hackingwithswift.com/) tutorial series.

This project takes a data feed from a website and parses it into useful information for users. We use UITabBarController, NSData, and JSON in order to construct the app. The JSON feed that the app uses is the freely available "We the people" Whitehouse petitions feed where Americans can submit requests for action and others can vote on them.
