# Names to Faces
This repo contains my tenth Swift project from Paul Hudson's awesome [Hacking With Swift](http://www.hackingwithswift.com/) tutorial series. It gets us started with UICollectionView and the photo library.

This is a fun, simple and useful app project that creates an app to help store names of people you've met. If you're a frequent traveller, or perhaps just bad at putting names to faces, this project will be perfect for you.

We will be using UICollectionViewController, UIImagePickerController and NSUUID. Plus we get to do more with our old pals CALayer, UIAlertController, NSData and closures. And above all, we are going to learn how to make a new data type from scratch for the first time.
